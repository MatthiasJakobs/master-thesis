\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{sec:chapter6}

- first: summarize experiments conducted

- mpii pose was quite close to original
- har pennaction did not work 
- jhmdb pose shows that model is able to adapt to different, smaller, but more complex dataset
- har jhmdb (TODO)
- end to end training is feasible. Intraclass variance and architecture design decisions need to be thought over.

\section{Future Work}
- use pose estimator architecture which works on video files
- more temporal context for action recognition
- bigger fully annotated video dataset
